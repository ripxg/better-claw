Review tool usage in recent session logs\n3. Identify underutilized capabilities\n\nPresent:\n- **Tool/Skill Name**: [name]\n- **What it does**: [1-sentence description]\n- **Why it's useful**: [practical benefit]\n- **Try it now**: [simple example we could do together]\n\nExamples of tools to explore:\n- browser: Web automation and research\n- nodes: Paired device control (phone camera, notifications)\n- canvas: Visual UI presentation\n- message: Cross-platform messaging\n- cron: This very feature!\n- Skills: weather, github, bird (Twitter), etc.\n\nKeep it practical and hands-on. Goal: actually TRY the tool together, not just read about it.\n\nTrack discoveries in memory/tool-discoveries.md to avoid repeats."
